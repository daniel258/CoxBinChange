\title{Calculating the probabilities of positive binary exposure status at a given time point using a proportional hazards calibration model}
\usage{
CalcCoxCalibP(w, w.res, point, fit.cox, hz.times, Q)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A matrix of time points when measurements on the binary covariate were obtained.}

\item{w.res}{A matrix of measurement results of the binary covariate. Each measurement corresponds to the time points in \code{w}}

\item{point}{The time point at which the probabilities are estimated}

\item{fit.cox}{The result of \code{icenReg::ic_sp} on the interval-censored data}

\item{hz.times}{Times used for calculating the baseline hazard function from PH calibartion model}

\item{Q}{Matrix of covariates for PH calibration model}
}
\value{
A vector of estimated probabilities of positive exposure status at time \code{point}.
}
\description{
For a given time point, calculate the probability of positive exposure value  for multiple observations (participants). 
The function uses the results of a proportional hazards calibration model fit, and given covariates and collected data on the history 
of the binary exposure for each participant.
