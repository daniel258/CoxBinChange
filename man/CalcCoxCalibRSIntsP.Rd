\title{Calculating the probabilities of positive binary exposure status at a given time point using proportional hazards grouped risk-set
 calibration models}
\usage{
CalcCoxCalibRSIntsP(w, w.res, point, fit.cox.rs.ints, hz.times, Q, pts.for.ints)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A matrix of time points when measurements on the binary covariate were obtained.}

\item{w.res}{A matrix of measurement results of the binary covariate. Each measurement corresponds to the time points in \code{w}}

\item{point}{The time point at which the probabilities are estimated}

\item{fit.cox.rs.ints}{The result of \code{FitCalibCoxRSInts} on the interval-censored data}

\item{hz.times}{Times used for calculating the baseline hazard function from PH calibartion model}

\item{Q}{Matrix of covariates for PH calibration model}

\item{pts.for.ints}{Points defining the intervals for grouping risk-sets (first one has to be zero). Should be sorted from zero up}
}
\value{
A vector of estimated probabilities of positive exposure status at time \code{point}.
}
\description{
For a given time point, calculate the probability of positive exposure value  for multiple observations (participants). 
The function uses the results of proportional hazards grouped risk-set calibration model fit, and given covariates and collected data on the history 
of the binary exposure for each participant.
