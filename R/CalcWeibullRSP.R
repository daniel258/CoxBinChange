#### CalcWeibullRSP function
## The function takes the following
## w - a matrix. Each row is observation and each column is questionnaire time in the interval. w equal to Inf once
# an observation is censore/had the event
## w.res - a matrix of the same dimensions as w. Equal to the x(t) at time w. For example second column is 
# second questionnaire result for all participents.
## point - scalar. The time of the risk set in the main analysis. In terms of the paper, t.
## obs.tm - the vector of observed times for all observaions. In terms of the paper, T. This is used for finding the risk set.
###
# The function returns a vector with individual predictions for P(X(t)=1|history(time t)). 
# For observations with X(a(t))=1 the above probability is 1 by definition and this is what the
# function returns for them.
# The function calculate prediction for all observations, even though predictions for observations outside 
# the risk set are not used 
#### The following functions is used: CalcAuxatPoint (R function), FindIntervalCalibCPP (cpp function)
